# Probleemoplossen-en-Ontwerpen-1
Code used in projects for the course "Probleemoplossen en Ontwerpen, deel 1", a course in the first semester of the first year of a Bachelor's degree in Engineering Science at KULeuven.
All code was written by me or posted with permission from group members.

- Project2AnimatieFilmpje.mlx: MATLAB-code for an animation of a simplified version of our "Pass-on Circuit", basically a car with only mechanical components that could receive a ball and pass it on to the next group. (see .avi or https://youtu.be/W0GClU2QGhg)  
  _Key techniques: central projection, translation and rotation in homogeneous coordinates, animated plotting_
